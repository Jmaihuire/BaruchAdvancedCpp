/*Discuss the following advantages of using C++ modules:
Modular design and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
C++ modules and header files living side by side.
Support for Information Hiding.
Less dependencies than using header files.
Create a mini-application containing three modules 
for Input, Processing and Output as well as a central Mediator. 
The code should show the application of the above features. 
You can take one of the sample cases from the videos.*/

// benefits of modules are more straightforward since don't have dependency issues 
// faster since no compiling (well only compiled once) 

int main() { 
	//Here you would just call the application and then it would ask for input, process, and return the output
	
	run(); // this is our run / call function 
        
}
